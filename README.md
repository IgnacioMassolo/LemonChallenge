# LemonChallenge

Hi! 

This is the Lemon Coding Challenge made by Ignacio Massolo

This project runs with Java 8, Springboot and gradle. It should run in any terminal with jdk8 and gradle (2.0 or higher).

NOTE: Take into account that there is a test commented because it implements a sleep of 10 seconds and it makes slower the process of running all the tests.
if you want to test the case where the user waits 10 seconds to send a new message, please uncomment that test and it will run properly :)

If support was needed, please reach out to nacho.massolo24@gmail.com.

Have a nice day
